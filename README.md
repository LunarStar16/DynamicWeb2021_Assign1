# University of Lethbridge Moodle Dark Mode Extension

## What This Extension Does:

This extension is just a simple dark mode that many websites tend to have such as Youtube or GitHub. This extension is meant to bring a dark mode to the University of Lethbridge moodle website. Allowing the user to see the site in a more darker appearance that is a little easier on the eyes. The extension should work on all current and previous classes the user may have and should hopefully work on all areas of the moodle site the user has access to. The extension works to modify the code of the moodle website by changing the colours of backgrounds, borders, text colour, as well as many other minor details that can be found on the site such as the calendar colours or menu items and links, It should also change the colour of the popup box that tells the user that they have been inactive for too long in their session. The University of Lethbridge logo is also updated through this extension so that it can be seen while using the dark mode extension. The dark mode extension uses much darker colours such as dark greys and other analogous colours for the backgrounds and borders, white for the text and blue to incorporate and keep some of the University's colours within the site.
